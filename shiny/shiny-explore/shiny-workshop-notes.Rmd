[Slides](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#1)

[Widgets beyond basic ones](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets)

`reactlog` is a package that tests R Shiny apps

[Shiny app repository structure](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#26)

`myapp` directory is the slug of our shiny on the webpage

[Two file shiny app](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#28)
- this is something to consider as the app gets larger 
- **global.R** file will be useful for data manipulating, etc.

[Adding inputs and outputs](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#32)
- there are more inputs than listed on the slide 

[Outputs and render functions](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#44)
- these sister functions are what makes the webpage elements reactive 

[Layouts](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#81)
- side bar layout is most popular 
- `navbarPage` is probably what we want to use 
- can nest layout functions within each other, but this needs to be done with the right function pairing 

[Themes](https://bootswatch.com/)

Software updates will likely break Shiny apps
- need to create a maintenance plan for our clients
