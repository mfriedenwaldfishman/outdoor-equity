This app combines two datasets to allow you to visualize patterns in how people 
are making reservations to California campsites. The app combines reservation data 
to overnight reservable sites from the 
[Recreation Information Database (RIDB)](https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) 
with data from the 
[United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). 
The data is joined based on the home ZIP code of the person making the reservation.
