Access to nature and other outdoor recreation have well-documented
positive impacts on mental physical well-being. In the United States,
there are many levels of government that manage public land, including
local, state, and federal agencies. Federal public land management
agencies in the United States offer a wide variety of activities to
visitors, such as picnicking in parks, hiking trails, tours, campsites,
and more. 

However, people from different socioeconomic and identity
groups access federal public lands unequally due to historical
discrimination and current inequities such as a lack of access to 
technology, not having the time or ability to plan vacations in advance, 
lack of knowledge of reservation systems, and cost. 

The multi-agency program, Recreation One Stop (R1S), oversees the operations of 
[Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/) and aims to increase access to 
recreation by providing online resources about nationwide recreational 
opportunities, allowing visitors to make reservations, and making the 
associated data accessible to all. The rich data on visitors that R1S 
collects presents an opportunity for the creation of more robust 
data-driven analytical tools to understand the patterns and correlations 
of this unequal access across the country and within individual recreation 
areas. Decision-makers can use these tools to explore and visualize how 
recreational opportunities on federal public lands are accessed.
