The shape of the curve can provide insight on the distribution of median-incomes. Taller peaks indicate a concentration of more people at a given median-income level, while flatter curves indicate a more even distribution. Comparing the green curve (all visitors to this site) to the grey curve (all California residents), can show who is more or less represented at this site compared to the California census.
