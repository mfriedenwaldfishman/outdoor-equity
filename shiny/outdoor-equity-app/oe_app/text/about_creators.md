This app was created by [Clarissa Boyajian](https://cboyajian.github.io/) 
and [Halina Do-Linh](https://hdolinh.github.io/). The app was created as their 
final capstone project for their Masters of Envrionmental Data Science degrees 
from the University of California's Bren School of Environmental Science and 
Management. Both women are passionate about environmental justice, open science, 
the art of data visualizations, and spending time recreating outdoors. 

Please reach out to either or both of us if you have questions about this 
project!
