Is there a difference in how far people who live in communities with different median incomes travel to campsites? 

For this example, we're interested in how far people from communities with different median-incomes are traveling to get to Upper Pines in Yosemite National Forest (the campsite with the most annual visits in California). To answer this question, click on the “Data Relationships” tab in the navigation bar. Under the drop-down labeled "1. Pick a relationship to visualize" choose "Median-income x distance traveled". Then under the drop-down options labeled "2. Subset the data", choose "NPS" from the agency drop-down, "Yosemite National Park" from the administrative unit drop-down, and "Upper Pines" from the reservable site drop-down. The plot below will appear:
