Is there a difference in how far people who live in communities with different 
median incomes travel to campsites? 

For this example, we're interested in Upper Pines in Yosemite National Forest 
(the campsite with the most annual visits in California). To answer this 
question, click on “Data Relationships” under the "Analysis" tab in the 
navigation bar. Then select the variables you want to compare, in this case 
"Race x Distance traveled", and the site you're interested in. Then scroll 
down to see two plots. 

Both plots have ten median-income brackets on the y-axis. The lollipop 
plot on the left shows the median distance traveled by people who live in 
communities with a median household income within each range. The bar plot 
on the right shows the total number of reservations to the selected site by 
people who live in communities with a median household income within each range.

Hover over the circles and bars on these plots to see more information about 
each group.
