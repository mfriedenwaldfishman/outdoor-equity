# Visualizing Visitor Use Trends at California Campsites to Explore Equitable Access

Federal lands in the United States provide important recreation opportunities to the public, but there is a **growing need to understand and mitigate inequities in access to outdoor recreation.** This project addressed this need by creating the [Outdoor Equity App](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/oe_app/), an **interactive platform** for summarizing and visualizing site-specific patterns and trends in visitation volume, demand, and visitorsâ€™ location of origin. The platform integrates nationwide [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/) reservation data with [US census data](https://www.census.gov/data.html) to:

- Gain insights into **demand for reservations** across different types of recreation areas.
- Analyze access to federal public lands among **historically underserved groups** in
relation to recreation **site type, cost, location, and demand**.
- Clearly define all variables and values in the **metadata documentation**.
- Allow users to **download a subset of the combined data** for further analysis.
