How far in advance do you have to reserve your site if you want to go to Upper 
Pines in Yosemite National Forest? This was the most visited site in all of 
California in 2018. Maybe you've visited Yosemite already, but are interested 
in visiting another nearby campsite, Dinkey Creek in Sierra National Forest. 
How far in advance will you need to book that site? 

To answer this question, click on “Data Summary” under the "Analysis" tab in 
the navigation bar. Then select the variable you want to see, in this case 
"booking window" and then select that you want to compare two sites. Then 
scroll down to select the two sites that you're interested in comparing. 

For this example you would select, "National Park Service" from the agency 
drop-down, "Yosemite National Park" from the administrative unit drop-down, 
and "Upper Pines" from the reservable site drop-down. Then for the second plot 
you would select "US Forest Service", then "Sierra National Forest", and then 
"Dinkey Creek". 

You will then see the two plots below. The y-axis shows the total number of 
reservations that are made at different numbers of days out from the start of a 
trip, shown on the x-axis. Hover over the bars on these histograms to see more 
information about the percentage of reservations made at different booking windows.
