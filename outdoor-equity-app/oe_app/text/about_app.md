This app is an interactive visualization tool that allows you to 
analyze patterns in the access and demand of visitors at reservable 
overnight reservable sites (such as campgrounds, cabins, hike-in, and 
more), using data from the 
[Recreation Information Database (RIDB)](https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) 
and the 
[United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). 
The analyses in this app allows you to explore relationships among attributes 
of recreation opportunities, reservation practices, and socioeconomic data 
from the regions of visitor origin.
