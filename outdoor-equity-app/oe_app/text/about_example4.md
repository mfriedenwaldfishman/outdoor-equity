What is the visitorshed of Upper Pines in Yosemite National Forest 
(the campsite with the most annual visits in California)?

A visitorshed is the area where visitors are coming from for a specific site. 
To create visitorshed maps, click on “Visitorshed Maps” under the "Analysis" 
tab in the navigation bar. Then select the site you're interested in. Then 
scroll down to see two maps. Please be patient, these maps can take a few 
seconds to load.

The first map shows the total number of visits coming from each state or US 
territory. The second map shows the location of the selected park as well 
as the total number of visits coming from each ZIP code within the state.

Zoom in and out, and click on a state, territory, or ZIP code to get more 
details about visitation.
