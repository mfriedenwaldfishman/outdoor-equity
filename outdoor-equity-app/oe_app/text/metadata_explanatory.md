The metadata for the joined RIDB-ACS dataset defines all variables. There are a total of 39 variables in the joined dataset. There is also an option to download the metatdata. 

The term "provenance" refers to the record trail that accounts for the origin of a variable. In this case, provenance refers to the scripts used to create the variable. These scripts can be found in the [Outdoor Equity Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/outdoor-equity/outdoor-equity).
