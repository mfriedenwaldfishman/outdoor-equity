This app combines two datasets to allow you to visualize patterns in how people 
are making reservations to campsites. The app combines reservation data 
of overnight reservable sites from the 
[Recreation Information Database (RIDB)](https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) 
with census data from the 
[United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). 
The data is joined based on the home ZIP code of the person making the 
reservation. Currently the app includes data for all campsites in California 
and all reservations made in 2018.
