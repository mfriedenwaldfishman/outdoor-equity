The shape of the curve can provide insight on the distribution of the percentage of people in a community who speak languages other than English  at home. Taller peaks indicate a concentration of more people living in communities at a given percent level, while flatter curves indicate a more even distribution. Comparing the green curve (all visitors to this site) to the grey curve (all California residents), can show who is more or less represented at this site compared to the CA census.
